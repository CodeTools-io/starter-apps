## Overview

A feature for viewing high-level information about systems and organizations.

One particularly interesting aspect of this dashboard is that tiles in the dashboard are populated and laid
out on the fly by examining the contents of list. This means that all you need to do to
add a new widget to the dashboard is to add the definition of the widget to the `widgets` directory and then
add a reference to the `widgets` list in `config/config.js`. You can define new sections in the dashboard by
modifying the `sections` list in the same file.

This makes development easier because an individual tile on the dashboard is almost completely independent of
others, but it also suggests the possibility that the contents of the dashboard could even be data driven because
the lists defined in `config/config.js` could easily be defined as state which could be modified.
