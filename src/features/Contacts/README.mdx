# Contacts

A feature for managing information about lists of people.

Since this is all about lists, this feature shows how application-defined components can transform list data structures into interated design elements in the browser as opposed to having a static structure.
Of particular interest in this feature is the way that elements of the contact list change their appearance and structure according to context such as whether contacts are being edited.
